# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-R-Project
Personal Project analyzing the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset on Kaggle.

In this project I explored different factors for airline passenger satisfaction through exploratory data analysis and model creation. Before this though, I made sure to analyze and clean the data to prepare for analysis. I detected and limited outliers, checked imbalance within the dependent variable, renamed variables for easy usage, and transformed data when necessary.

The main portions of the data analysis lie within the Further Exploring the Data and Model section. In the Further Exploring the Data section many visualizations were created to assess the relationships between variables and uncover trends, complementing some visualizations with hypothesis testing using a chi-squared test. In the model section, a random forest regression and logisitic regression model were created and analyzed.

Passenger_Satisfaction.Rmd contains the relevant R code for the project while Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction.pdf contains the written report with the relevent code output.
